# 🕌 دليلك للأقصى — Your Guide to Al-Aqsa

**An offline, visual navigation app for visitors of Al-Aqsa Mosque.**  
Built with React for a hackathon project to support on-site guidance without relying on GPS or internet.

---

## 📱 What It Does

This app helps visitors navigate inside the Al-Aqsa Mosque and surrounding alleys by using:

- 🧭 Step-by-step **image-based directions**
- 🏛️ **Landmark info** along the way
- 📷 A visual-based **location finder**
- 📵 Works **completely offline**

---

## 💡 Why We Built It

During religious occasions, Al-Aqsa gets incredibly crowded — GPS becomes unreliable, and internet access is limited.

This app solves that by guiding users **offline**, using:
- Photos of familiar landmarks
- Pre-loaded directions
- No need for maps or data
